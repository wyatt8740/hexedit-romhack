# hexedit 0.9.7 - romhack edition

This is not my code. I found it years and years ago on a site I have since
forgotten, and thought it could do with some exposure.

The code itself appears to be about 20 years old now, but it still configures
and compiles out-of-the-box! I at least think that's admirable and hope my
code has that kind of longevity.

In case I ever do change the code in the future, note that the initial commit
represents the exact contents of the tarball I had on my web server (which
is currently isolated from the outside world by a draconian University
firewall, and has been for several years now).

I might try to make a Windows build using pdcurses at some point. That'd
really give me a good idea of how portable it is. I don't use Windows for
anything, though, so it's not a high priority.

It appears that it is a hack of the hex editor by Adam Rogoyski available at
http://www.rogoyski.com/adam/programs/hexedit/ , which is GPL2-licensed, which
adds support for .tbl files (commonly used when rom-hacking games with
uncompressed text; basically they can convert non-ASCII text so it appears as
strings in the 'text' column of the editor). 

It might get more notice on a public git host, anyway. And maybe I'll
hack at it a bit at some point. I like it a lot for ROM hacking and
just editing binary files in general.

Be sure to read `README.romhack` and the original `README` files as well for
more details and instructions on how to use this program.
